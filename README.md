مهمة الاسبوع الخامس تثبيت الturtlebot3 ومحاولة رسم الروبوت لخريطة الشكل

to download the software of turtlebot3 i went to the turtlebot3 website and click the 'quick start guide' then i followed the written steps and write the command in terminal and finaly it's gonna open the window of gazebo to create the map of the space that the robot walked in but it didn't work and the program couldn't create the map because i did use a robot to inter the coordinate at home.
and i used the noetic ros installation .
